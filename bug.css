The CSS rule `:focus-visible` pseudo-class is not supported in older browsers (like Internet Explorer) leading to unexpected behavior when elements gain focus.

```css
a:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

This code intends to add an outline to links only when the focus is programmatically triggered (e.g. using JavaScript).  Older browsers lack support for `:focus-visible`, which causes the outline to appear on all focus events, including those triggered by mouse clicks, leading to a cluttered visual experience.
